# ToDoListApp
# Todo List Application (Java)

## Project Description
The **Todo List Application** is a simple Java desktop program made using **Java Swing**.  
It allows users to add tasks, view them in a table, and track their status.

This project was created to practice **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and enums.

---

## Objectives
- To create a simple task management system
- To apply OOP concepts in a real program
- To use Java Swing for building a graphical user interface
- To understand how MVC structure works in Java

---

## Features
- Add a new task using a form
- View all tasks in a table
- Set task status (Not Started, Ongoing, Completed)
- Automatically generate task IDs
- Prevent opening multiple task forms at the same time

---

## OOP Concepts Applied
- **Abstraction** – `AbstractTask` class
- **Inheritance** – `Task` and `TimedTask` classes
- **Encapsulation** – private fields with getters and setters
- **Enum** – used for task status
- **Polymorphism** – tasks handled using `AbstractTask` reference

---

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Java Swing
- MVC (Model–View–Controller)
- IntelliJ / Eclipse / NetBeans / VS Code
